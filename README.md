## 🚀 Features

### ML Model
- **Flood Detection Model:** Processes real-time satellite imagery (Sentinel-1 SAR & NOAA-20 VIIRS) to identify flood-affected areas with 92%+ accuracy.
- **Victim Detection Model:** Detects humans and animals in satellite or drone images and flags high-risk zones for prioritized rescue operations.

### Web Application
- **SOS Button:** Victims can send a distress signal instantly by pressing a single button.
- **Live Location Capture:** Captures user's live location and checks for disaster presence via satellite mapping.
- **Instant Alerting:** Automatically notifies NGOs, rescue teams, and authorities.
